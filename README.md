# Email-Automation-for-Flight-Tickets-

This project is intended to provide better support for those wanting to travel but too lazy to actually do the research.

The software/website allows the user to enter a destination, origin, and departure times, and reports weekly with an email of the best
available flight tickets for the senario using the Amadeus API. 

Access to the website is here: http://ec2-13-59-242-68.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/
Once the fields are entered, an email will be automatically be sent, signing you up.

Instructions for use:
First run the flask file on AWS EC2
Then go to the website and it should display the differnt fields to enter.
